        description: "Camp Rapidfire is located along the mighty Ganga in Rishikesh, which is an adventure loverâ€™s haven. It is a river beach camp which means that it is situated on a large tract of white sand along the river banks. This sure is as exciting and peaceful as it sounds with ample opportunity to laze out in the sun and hear the Ganga flowing by. Being the most popular rafting destination, there is no dearth of adventure activities in Rishikesh. There is no electricity at this camp which is lighted by kerosene lamps after sunset, giving it a completely ethereal feel. It is a complete bliss to observe the stars at night and pass your time away from the noise of the crowded cities."
